# Features
Two quality-of-life modules for Anomaly G.A.M.M.A 0.9.1 (Christmas Update) to consolidate some weapon-related keybinds, as well as better ammo check animations.
- **The two modules can be installed indepedently or together.**
- **Keybinds and modifiers can be customized in Mod Configuration Menu -> One Key.**

## Module 1. One Key Reload + Unviersally Animated Ammo Check
### One Key Reload: consolidates a few functions onto the reload key (default R)
- Single-tap R = reload; hold R = ammo check; double-tap R = change ammo type; Shift + R = unjam/inspect
- Note: you can either use the engine keybind "Reload", or the MCM keybind from this mod.

### Unviersally Animated Ammo Check
- For weapons without ammo-check animations, play the reload animation instead. For weapons without magazines, play a lower/raise animation.

Required addons need to be loaded first:
- 207- Mags Redux (Disable G.A.M.M.A. Unjam Reload) - RavenAscendant
- 261- Ammo Check - Ishmaeel

## Module 2. One Key Firemode: keybinds consolidated to X by default.
- Tap X = select next fire mode; Shift + X = select previous fire mode; hold X = check fire mode
- Note: In game settings -> controls, "Previous Firing Mode" and "Next Firing Mode" need to be bound to something else (e.g. 0 and 9).

# Installation:
- If you use module 1 (One Key Reload + Unviersally Animated Ammo Check), make sure to load the following addons before this:
 - 207- Mags Redux (Disable G.A.M.M.A. Unjam Reload) - RavenAscendant
 - 261- Ammo Check - Ishmaeel
 - (Optional, but compatible) Devices of Anomaly Redone
