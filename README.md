# Introduction
A small script for Anomaly G.A.M.M.A 0.9.1 (Christmas Update) to consolidate the keybinds for reload/check ammo/unjam. Assuming your reload key is bind to "R", you can:
 - Tap "R" key to reload.
 - Press and hold "R" key to check ammo.
 - "Shift + R" to unjam weapon (if weapon is functional, will try to play inspection animation).

The original keybinds for unjam (default F10) and check ammo (default Shift + F) are still functional. Feel free to unbind them if you'd like.

# Installation:

 - Make sure to load the following addons before this:
   - 207- Mags Redux (Disable G.A.M.M.A. Unjam Reload) - RavenAscendant
   - 261- Ammo Check - Ishmaeel

 - Download the .7z file and install with Mod Organzier.

# To-do:
 - Streamline firemode switch/checking (hold "X" to check, tap "X" to switch, etc.)
