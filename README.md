# Introduction
A small script for Anomaly G.A.M.M.A 0.9.1 (Christmas Update) to consolidate some weapon-related keybinds:

Reload Key (default R, change in settings -> controls)
 - Tap "R" key to reload.
 - Double tap "R" to change ammo type.
 - Press and hold "R" key to check ammo.
 - "Shift + R" to unjam weapon (if weapon is functional, will try to play inspection animation).
Note: The original keybinds for unjam (default F10) and check ammo (default Shift + F) are still functional. But feel free to unbind them if you'd like.

Fire mode select key (default X, change in MCM -> One Key)
 - Tap "X" to select next fire mode
 - "Shift + X" to select previous fire mode
 - Hold "X" to view current fire mode
 Note: In game settings -> controls, rebind "Previous Fire Mode" and "Next Fire Mode" to some other key (the default: "9" and "0" works fine).
