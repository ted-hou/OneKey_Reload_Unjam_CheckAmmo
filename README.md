# Features
A small script for Anomaly G.A.M.M.A 0.9.1 (Christmas Update) to consolidate some weapon-related keybinds, as well as better ammo check animations:

## Reload/Ammo Check/Unjam/Ammo Type Keybinds (default R, change in settings -> controls)
 - Tap "R" key to reload.
 - Double tap "R" to change ammo type.
 - Press and hold "R" key to check ammo.
 - "Shift + R" to unjam weapon (if weapon is functional, will try to play inspection animation).
Note: The original keybinds for unjam (default F10) and check ammo (default Shift + F) are still functional. But feel free to unbind them if you'd like.

## Fire Mode Select Keybinds (default X, change in MCM -> One Key)
 - Tap "X" to select next fire mode
 - "Shift + X" to select previous fire mode
 - Hold "X" to view current fire mode
 Note: In game settings -> controls, rebind "Previous Fire Mode" and "Next Fire Mode" to some other key (the default: "9" and "0" works fine).

## Unviersally Animated Ammo Check
 - Adds a small script (modified from [Devices of Anomaly Redone](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/devices-of-anomaly-redone)) so all weapons should play some sort of ammo check animation:
  - Ammo check animation from the weapon pack.
  - (Fallback 1) Reload animation (works pretty well on early-game AK's, for example)
  - (Fallback 2) Lower, then raise the weapon (used for weapons that don't use magazines)
Note: to make this work, the "Busy Hands Fix" option in Ammo Check (Ishmaeel) MCM settings now does nothing.
