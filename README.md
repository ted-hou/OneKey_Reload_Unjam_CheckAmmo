# Features
A small script for Anomaly G.A.M.M.A 0.9.1 (Christmas Update) to consolidate some weapon-related keybinds, as well as better ammo check animations.
- **Features 1 and 2 can be installed indepedently or together.**
- **Keybinds and modifiers can be customized in Mod Configuration Menu -> One Key.**

## Feature 1
### 1a. Reload/Ammo Check/Unjam/Ammo Type keybinds consolidated 
- default **R**
 - Tap **R** key to reload.
 - Double tap **R** to change ammo type.
 - Press and hold **R** key to check ammo.
 - **Shift + R** to unjam or inspect weapon
Note: The original keybinds for unjam (default **F10**) and check ammo (default **Shift + F**) are still functional. But feel free to unbind them if you'd like.

### 1b. Unviersally Animated Ammo Check
- All weapons should play some sort of ammo check animation:
 - Ammo check animation from the weapon pack.
 - (Fallback 1) Reload animation
 - (Fallback 2) Lower, then raise the weapon (for weapons that don't use magazines)

## Feature 2. Fire Mode Select keybinds consolidated
- default **X**
 - Tap **X** to select next fire mode
 - **Shift + X** to select previous fire mode
 - Hold **X** to view current fire mode
Note: In game settings -> controls, rebind "Previous Fire Mode" and "Next Fire Mode" to some other key (the default: **9** and **0** works fine).
